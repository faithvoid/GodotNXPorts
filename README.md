# Godot NX Ports (Repository is currently a WIP)
A compilation of Godot homebrew ports for the Nintendo Switch using Stary2001's Godot engine port. Some ports may have bugs that will be listed in each individual game section. Some games may have a small amount of microstutter and longer-than-normal load times, but not to the point of being unplayable.
